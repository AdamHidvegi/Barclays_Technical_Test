Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the first task, but I had some thoughts about it what I can share.

I tried to create the basic situation using "if" statements:
If an account has a specific name (e.g. 1.wholesale, 2.internal) and the product we'd like to add for this account has the right specification (1. > Â£35.000 GBP value, 2.it is a Tier 1 Capital product), we could add a product to an account. Without the correct basic situation and the right data structure I wasn't able to start to do the actual questions during this task.

About the questions and methods:
I think the way I tried to solve this task wasn't right, because it seems that for the second question (calculate the Net Worth Value) I'd have needed an array of accounts in order to loop through them. During this process I'd have been able to sum those values using the specifications (cash, bond and tier 1 capital would have been positive values and collateralised loan would have been a negative value according to the Product Offerings table).
For the third question I'd have used the given formula in order to calculate the SWRA for every product and use those values instead of the asset values from the previous question to calculate the Net Worth GBP Value.
