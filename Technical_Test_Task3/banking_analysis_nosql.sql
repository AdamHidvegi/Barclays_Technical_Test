NoSQL: “Not Only SQL” or “Non-relational” database
Types of NoSQL databases: Key value Stores (Riak, Voldemort, and Redis), Wide Column Stores (Cassandra and HBase), Document databases (MongoDB), Graph databases (Neo4J and HyperGraphDB)

Question 1:

{
  "Account_Details": {
    "Account_Number": "80823221",
    "City": "Glasgow",
    "Start_Date": "2020.01.01"
  },
  "Daily_Activity": {
    "Account_Number": "80823221",
    "Last_Login_Date": "2020.01.18",
    "Daily_Usage_Mins": "Last_Login": "5"
  }
}


Question 2:

Advantages:   Schema free
              Doesn't require object-relational mapping
              Can handle Data variety and huge amounts of data
              NoSQL databases scale out on low cost, commodity hardware, allowing for almost unlimited growth

Disadvantages:  Open source - there is no reliable standard for NoSQL
                Large document size - for example descriptive key names increase the document size
                Data management in NoSQL is much more complex than a relational database
                Less support˚
